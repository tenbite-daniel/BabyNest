  description: >
    **Role**: BabyNest Main Orchestration Agent (The Router)
    **Objective**: Analyze the user's raw query: "{user_query}" to determine the core data type required (Factual/Medical OR Subjective/Community).
    
    **CRITICAL BEHAVIOR (DELEGATION)**:
    1. If the query requires *medical facts, guidelines, or clinical risks* (e.g., "What are the stages of labor?"), delegate the entire task to the **maternal_health_researcher**.
    2. If the query requires *personal stories, emotional tips, or subjective experiences* (e.g., "What does postpartum fatigue really feel like?"), delegate the entire task to the **community_testimonials_researcher**.
    3. If both are needed, delegate to **maternal_health_researcher** first, then have that agent delegate to the other. (For maximum efficiency, only delegate once if possible).
    
    The delegated agent MUST execute its tools and return its structured output (Research Report or Testimonial Summary) as the final result of this task.
  expected_output: >
    The full, final output (a structured report or summary) generated by the agent you delegated to (e.g., "A concise, structured research report..." OR "A summary of authentic, subjective community experiences...").
